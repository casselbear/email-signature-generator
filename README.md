# email-signature-generator

*An Email Signature Generator that takes user inputs and returns preformatted HTML ready for Gmail. The signature is previewed in a container, and easily copied using a button.*

## Background
This is a tool I built for my marketing agency. Previously, emails were formatted in Excel and copied into the Gmail signature box. This limited the design and was prone to inconsistencies and mistakes. 

I redesigned our email siganture in HTML to modernize the design. The new process required a user inputing their info into the HTML template, and opening in a borser to copy. Since using a code editor or plain text is not familiar to everyone, this too had its share of problems.

This signature generator was created to make the process of creating or updating employee Gmail signatures easy, quick, and foolproof.
